Enabling Driver Controlled TeleOp from the comfort of home and control your robot remotely.

# About TeleDrive

The COVID-19 pandemic left FIRST Tech Challenge competitions, scrimmages, and team driver practice in the dark. Because of local restrictions, many teams use online resources like Zoom to communicate and start preparing for the next season. However, there still isn't a solution to being able to practice driving the robot as well as coordinating competitions and scrimmages - all remotely... until now! TeleDrive is a simple, but powerful tool that allows teams to control their robot from the comfort of their homes. Using this, competitions can be run remotely and teams can drive their robot without having to worry about personal health and safety. Our program uses simple commands to bring low-latency and high-performance control, just as if controlling your robot on the field.

All of this is able to happen within 1/40 of a second, bringing the most performance with the least latency.
